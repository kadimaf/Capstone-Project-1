# **Proposal for Apartment Management System**  

## **Vision Statement**  
To create a fully integrated apartment management system that can assist property managers, tenants, and service providers in their interactions, and make property management processes more effective and less ambiguous.
## **Project Overview**  
The Apartment Management System is an online application which is intended to assist in the management of residential properties and make the process easier. It will act as a single entry point through which property managers can oversee rent payments, maintenance requests, and financial reports, whereas tenants will be able to pay rent, request maintenance, and download documents. Other service providers, including maintenance personnel, will also be able to receive and manage work orders. Therefore, the platform is expected to enhance the coordination between the various stakeholders, reduce the use of paper based worksheets and enhance the overall efficiency of property management functions.
### **Features**  
- **Simplified rent collection** by integrating with PayPal.  
- **Monitoring and controlling of the maintenance requests.**  
- **Real time communication** between stakeholders.  
- **Leases and other important documents** can be found in the document organization section.  
- **Analysis and reporting of the financials.**  
- **Access control** based on roles for various user categories.  

### **Technological Framework**  
Our platform will be built using latest web technologies to develop a web application that is adaptive, protected and expandable:
- **Front End:** React.js to offer a user-friendly interface.  
- **Back End:** Django to ensure strong data management and execution of business logic.  
- **Hosting:** AWS to provide reliable deployment and scalability.  
- **Containerization:** Docker For better control of the application.
